# Tata 1 mg

- Tata 1mg, previously 1mg, is a healthcare platform based in Gurugram, India. It provides services, including e-pharmacy, diagnostics, e-consultation and health content.
- We are a team of 6 from Unit-1, Masai School, batch FT-16, who worked on cloning the Tata 1mg website as part of our Unit-1 construct week. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an e-commerce page, where a customer can view and filter products, add their product to a cart and place his or her order's.
